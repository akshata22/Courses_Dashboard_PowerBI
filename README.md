# 📊 Online Course Analysis Dashboard

This project explores trends in online learning across various course categories, languages, skills, and instructors. The goal was to understand which types of courses attract high learner engagement, what skills are in demand, and how accessibility features like subtitles and language influence viewership.  

The dataset included attributes such as course category, sub-category, language, number of viewers, skills, instructor ratings, subtitles, and duration.  
I cleaned and transformed the dataset directly in Power BI’s Query Editor, ensuring consistent formats, handling missing values, and preparing the data for visual analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

**Power BI** -  Data modeling, cleaning (Query Editor), DAX calculations, and dashboard design 
**Excel / CSV Data** -  Source dataset before import into Power BI
